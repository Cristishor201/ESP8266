# Downloading

Well, first of all let's download [Oracle Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). In my case I will use Widows host option.

Then download Ubuntu or Linux. Both Virtual Box and Ubuntu, should be free, so there it would not be any problem with the license stuff. In this example I will use [Ubuntu Server 20.04.2 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04.2/ubuntu-20.04.2-live-server-amd64.iso), but you are free to use [any Ubuntu version](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) you want.

# Prerequites

Now it's time to install and configure Virtual Box.
The process it's quite simple, but for the sake of it, I will put all the necessary details.

## Install

**Step 1**<br>
Run the installation of the virtual box. Click next.<br>

**Step 2**<br>
Choose to take all options, and also pick the location where you want to install Virtual Box. I recommend you to install virtual box on the computer at least, and the OS on the hard drive. Also it's a best practice to use underline or dash instead white spaces.<br>

**Step 3**<br>
On next step I choosed to uncheck the shorcut of Quick launch Bar, but you can checked up if you want.<br>
