# Prerequites

Before we start to install the OS, we need a couple of things first: to downoad it, and to write it on a DVD. There may be also to make a USB bootable, but for this tutorial I will cover only by CD (DVD). At least for now.<br>

**Step 1**<br>
Download ubuntu desktop from [here](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).<br>
This is what I installed: [Ubuntu 20.04.2.0 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?version=20.04.2.0&architecture=amd64).

**Step 2**<br>
Go to [http://www.winiso.com/](http://www.winiso.com/) and download the free tool. What I like it on this software, it's that it's free for making bootalble DVD. Exactly what we need for making our ubuntu os bootable.
